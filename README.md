# Space Exploration Site

## Overview

This project is a static landing page for a fictional space exploration company. The design is focused on creating an engaging and modern user interface that captures the theme of space and technology. It was built as a learning project to practice fundamental front-end development skills and integrate custom assets.

## Key Learnings & Features

1. Google Fonts Integration: I used Google Fonts to incorporate the Orbitron typeface, which gives the site a futuristic and thematic feel.

2. Hero Section Design: The website features a hero section with a background image, a logo, and a call-to-action button, demonstrating a common and effective web design pattern.

3. Fundamental CSS Properties: The styling utilizes a wide range of CSS properties for color, typography, text shadows, and automatic centering of elements (margin: auto and display: block).

4. Separation of Concerns: The project maintains a clean structure with HTML handling the content and CSS managing all styling, which is a best practice for web development.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML5

2. CSS3

## How to Run

To run this project, ensure you have the styles.css file in the same directory as the index.html file. You will also need to have the universe.webp file in an images folder, as linked in the CSS. Then, simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

## Future Improvements

This project serves as an excellent foundation for more advanced web development concepts. Potential future improvements could include:

1. Responsiveness: Implementing media queries to ensure the layout remains visually appealing on a variety of screen sizes.

2. Interactive Form: Adding a form for the "Apply" button and using JavaScript to handle user submissions.

3. Animations: Integrating subtle animations or parallax scrolling effects to create a more dynamic and immersive user experience.
